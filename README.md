Welcome to the Amazon Sales Analysis project! In this project, we delve into analyzing sales
data from Amazon to extract insights and trends that can help optimize sales strategies,
understand customer behavior, and improve business operations.
## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing Amazon sales records, including
information such as sales dates, customer details, product categories, and revenue figures. By
leveraging SQL queries and data analysis techniques, we aim to answer various questions and
uncover valuable insights from the dataset.
## Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project consists of 9990 rows of data, representing Amazon
sales transactions. Along with the sales data, the dataset includes information about customers,
products, orders, and returns. Before analysis, the dataset underwent preprocessing to handle
missing values and ensure data quality.
## Analysis Questions Resolved
During the analysis, the following key questions were addressed using SQL queries and data
analysis techniques:
1. What is the total revenue generated?
2. How many products do we have?
3. Find out top 5 order details by sales amount?
4. What is the average order value?
5. What is the total sale for GOA?
6. How many unique customers have placed orders?
7. What is the total sales revenue generated by each state?
8. Find top 3 products and revenue generated having revenue > 30000
9. Which is the best selling month in 2022 based on revenue?
10. How many orders were placed by each customer, and what is their average order quantity?
11. Which category has the highest average sale amount per order?
12. Identify the top 3 best-selling products(sub-categories) in terms of total quantity sold.
13. Identify all orders that have been returned, along with the details of the returns (if available).
14. Find customers name and total orders and total revenue
15. Find all instances where products have been sold, returned, or both, along with the associated details.
16. Which customers have placed orders with a total sale amount greater than the average sale amount across all orders? (Subquery)
17. What is the total quantity of products sold in each category, and how does it compare to the average quantity sold across all categories?
18. Find top 5 products whose revenue has decreased compared to previous year
19. Find Top 5 states by total orders where each state sale is greater than average orders accross orders.
20. Find the details of the top 5 products with the highest total sales, where the total sale for each product is greater than the average sale across all products.
21. List all orders along with the product details (product name, price) and seller details (seller name) for each order.
22. Find the total sales amount for each category.
23. List all customers who have made returns along with the number of returns made by each customer.
24. Find the average price of products sold by each seller.
25. Identify the top 3 sellers based on the total sales amount.
26. List all orders where the quantity sold is greater than the average quantity sold across all orders.
27. Find the total sales amount for each category in each state.
28. List the products that have not been sold yet.
29. Find the total sales amount for each seller, excluding the sales amount for orders with returns.
30. Identify the customers who have made orders in more than one state.
31. Classify orders by quantity: Categorize orders as "Low," "Medium," or "High" based on the quantity ordered.
32. Categorize products by price range: Classify products as "Low," "Medium," or "High" based on their price.
33. Identify returning customers: Label customers as "Returning" if they have placed more than one returns; otherwise, mark them as "New."
34. Determine seller performance: Evaluate sellers as "Top Performer" if their total sales amount exceeds the average sales amount; otherwise, classify them as "Average Performer."

An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) has been created to visualize the relationships between
the tables in the dataset. This diagram provides a clear understanding of the data structure and
helps in identifying key entities and their attributes.
## Getting Started
To replicate the analysis or explore the dataset further, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have a SQL environment set up to execute queries.
3. Load the provided dataset into your SQL database.
4. Execute the SQL queries provided in the repository to analyze the data and derive insights.
5. Customize the analysis or queries as needed for your specific objectives.
## Conclusion
Through this project, we aim to provide valuable insights into Amazon sales trends, customer
preferences, and other factors influencing e-commerce operations. By analyzing the dataset
and addressing the key questions, we hope to assist stakeholders in making informed decisions
and optimizing their sales strategies.
